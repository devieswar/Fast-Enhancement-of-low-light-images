# Fast-Enhancement-of-low-light-images

Many image enhancement techniques are in use to boost the standard of the image. Because the
technology is developing, people want even better quality pictures from low-quality pictures just
like the images captured under extremely low light and are corrupted with noise. Fast imaging
allows image enhancement in low light conditions. Image enhancement is the procedure of
improving the standard and knowledge content of original data before processing. Within the
past, a spread of image enhancement techniques like deblurring and denoising were proposed.
But under extreme conditions, these techniques may not give accurate results. To beat these
difficulties, a learning-based image enhancement is proposed during this paper. The procedure
employed in this approach can enhance images that are of low lighting (<0.1 lux) and Short
exposure (6.67 ms). This method also works for long-exposure reference images. Here, a
light-weight convolutional network is developed with fewer parameters and includes a lower
computation cost than normal networks. may be} difficult to develop by using traditional
methods but can be made possible by using the neural network concept. The proposed system
uses lightweight convolutional neural networks which permit fast image enhancement is feasible
under extremely low light conditions.
